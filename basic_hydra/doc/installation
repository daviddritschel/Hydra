                      Brief Installation Notes
                      ========================

     The first thing to do is change the base name of the hydra
directory from "basic_hydra" to "hydra". Ideally, put this in your
home directory. This is the "trunk of the tree" (or the body of
the hydra!).

     The hydra package makes widespread use of makefiles, c-shell
scripts and python scripts (python3.0 or higher).  When using a
linux-based operating system (which is the basis for Apple Macintosh
operating systems), these features are commonly available and there is
nothing to install.  Some numerical and graphics extensions used by
python scripts may need to be installed, in particular "numpy" and
"matplotlib" (these are freely available).  Using a Windows operating
system is not recommended, as many features either do not exist or
would take great effort to get working.

     The hydra package is otherwise fully self-contained.  Users
should modify the scripts "machine", "homedir" and "workdir" in the
scripts subdirectory (~/hydra/scripts) to be consistent with their own
computer and user/work space organisation, and be sure to add "hydra"
to their path (indicating which directories to search for scripts).
It is also handy to add "." to the path, for example the line

set path = ( $path ~/hydra/scripts . )

in .cshrc if you use the tcsh shell.  The package is then ready
for use once you have updated the path, e.g. by 

source .cshrc

(the path is automatically updated when starting a new shell).  Simply
typing "hydra" will give the user various options for setting up a
flow simulation.  For a list of handy scripts and what they do, please
see the file "tools" in this directory (~/hydra/doc).

Historical note: the hydra package was first created in 1993.

Further information: There are additional features which can be
provided upon request (email david.dritschel@st-andrews.ac.uk),
such as applications to other physical systems or geometries.
