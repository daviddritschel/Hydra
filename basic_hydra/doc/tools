              Commonly used tools for the hydra package
              -----------------------------------------

   The following is a list of tools or scripts available to all parts of 
the hydra package.  (A few "geometry" specific scripts are listed after.)
In most cases, typing the name of the tool (or the name followed by -h) 
gives a description of the arguments which are required and those which 
are optional.  Defaults can be found at the top of most scripts.

   Note, all these can be executed from any location, as long as your
path variable is correctly set, as discussed in the "installation" file 
in this directory.

Script name    Type      Function

bjob           csh       Launches a background process, niced at level 19.
                         This is used widely by flow-setup scripts to start
                         a simulation and leave it running even if the user
                         logs out of the shell.
                         =>  Type bjob to view all options.

data2mp4       python    Takes data files ending in .r8, .r4, .i4, .i2, .c2,
                         .c1, .asc. or .dat and creates a movie in mp4 format.
                         =>  Use -h to view all options.

dataview       python    Takes data files ending in .r8, .r4, etc and creates
                         images in a resizeable and zoom-able window on the 
                         screen.  Advance forward by pressing or holding down
                         the "=" key (below "+") or backwards using the "-"
                         key.  Buttons at the bottom of the image allow one
                         to export a particular image to a wide variety of
                         image formats (png, eps, pdf, etc).
                         =>  Use -h to view all options.

diffview       python    Like dataview, but takes two identically-formatted
                         files, e.g. F1 and F2, and subtracts the data in F1
                         from that in F2 before imaging the difference data.
                         =>  Use -h to view all options.

homedir        csh       Returns the directory containing the user's home
                         directory, usually "/user" but sometimes "/home"
                         (*** modify contents of homedir if necessary ***)

hydra          csh       Main package script for launching simulations.
                         Typing "hydra -h" gives some general information
                         about the hydra package, including its structure.

machine        csh       Returns the name of the fortran compiler 
                         depending on the name of the host machine.
                         (*** It is necessary to modify this file and
                         provide the machine names on your network ***)

plotcol        python    General plotting routine for readable/ascii text 
                         files (normally ending in .asc or .dat).  Makes
                         a separate plot for each column, assuming the 
                         first column is the "x" coordinate.  The first
                         plot uses the second column as the "y" coordinate,
                         etc.  The option "-hold" allows one to plot 
                         everything in one image.
                         =>  Use -h to view all options.

precomp        csh       C pre-processor for passing arguments; used within
                         the flow-setup scripts available in the "scripts"
                         directory of each simulation method.  Normally,
                         this works on the file "parameters.f90", containing
                         a list of job parameters.  This script is not usually
                         used on its own, but could be.
                         =>  Type precomp to view all options.

workdir        csh       Returns the "working directory", where you want to
                         create and run jobs.  Normally this is "/local_raid"
                         but can be "/scratch" etc.  
                         @@ Do not use your home directory! Keep the hydra
                         directory structure unchanged to simplify updates. 
                         (*** modify contents of workdir if necessary ***)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scripts commonly found in the "scripts" directory of each simulation method
       i.e. in ~/hydra/<method>/<geometry>/<equations>/scripts
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Script name    Type      Function

flow-setup     csh       Sets up a simulation, including compiling, and
                         creating a job directory containing many post-
                         processing tools.
                         (*** modify if new initialisation routines are
                         added; for each new such routine, you will need
                         to create a local script here, and also add a
                         line to the makefile "init.make" in the "init"
                         subdirectory located on the same level as the
                         "scripts" subdirectory. ***)

spec_view      python    Views spectra for each time frame.  The spectra 
                         are written out by the "evolution.f90" module in
                         the directory containing the main fortran90 source
                         codes, e.g. "casl".   Advance forward by pressing or 
                         holding down the "=" key (below "+") or backwards 
                         using the "-"key.  Buttons at the bottom of the 
                         image allow one to export a particular image to 
                         a wide variety of image formats (png, eps, pdf, etc).
                         =>  Use -h to view all options.

zonalview      python    Views zonally-averaged quantities (e.g. u(y) with
                         u along the "x" axis and y along the "y" axis)) at
                         each time frame.  The required data are normally
                         produced by running the fortran90 executable "zonal"
                         at the completion of a run.
                         See spec_view above for viewing instructions.
                         =>  Use -h to view all options.

Note: there are typically many other scripts available - they are well
commented so you can see what they do.
